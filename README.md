# User Management Dashboard

## Objective

The **User Management Dashboard** is a web application that allows users to view, add, edit, and delete user details from a mock backend API. The application fetches data from the JSONPlaceholder API, a free online REST API for testing and demonstration purposes.

## Features

- **View Users**: Display a list of users with details such as ID, First Name, Last Name, Email, and Department.
- **Add Users**: Add a new user by submitting the form.
- **Edit Users**: Edit the details of an existing user.
- **Delete Users**: Delete an existing user from the list.
- **Error Handling**: Show appropriate error messages when an API request fails.
- **Optional Enhancements**: Implement pagination, client-side validation for forms, and make the interface responsive.

## Requirements

1. **User Interface**:
   - Display a table of users with the following columns:
     - ID
     - First Name
     - Last Name
     - Email
     - Department
   - Provide options to:
     - Add a new user
     - Edit an existing user
     - Delete a user
   - Provide a form to input user details when adding or editing a user.

2. **Backend Interaction**:
   - Use the [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) with the `/users` endpoint to fetch and manipulate user data.
   - Handle API responses for success and failure.

3. **Functionality**:
   - **View**: Fetch user data from the `/users` endpoint and display it in a table.
   - **Add**: Send a POST request to the `/users` endpoint to simulate adding a user (JSONPlaceholder will not persist data).
   - **Edit**: Send a PUT request to update user details on the `/users` endpoint.
   - **Delete**: Send a DELETE request to remove a user.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Show error messages in case of API request failures (e.g., network errors, invalid responses).

5. **Bonus (Optional)**:
   - Implement pagination or infinite scrolling for the user list.
   - Add client-side validation to ensure form fields are properly filled out.
   - Make the user interface responsive for different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend Framework**: React (or Vanilla JavaScript/Other Frameworks)
- **Backend Interaction**: Axios or Fetch API for HTTP requests
- **UI Framework**: Bootstrap / Tailwind CSS / Plain CSS (based on your choice)
- **API**: JSONPlaceholder (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)

## Setup and Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/UserDashboard.git
2. Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project folder and install dependencies using npm or yarn:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd UserDashboard
npm install
OR

bash
Copy
Edit
cd UserDashboard
yarn install
3. Run the Application
After installation, run the following command to start the development server:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm start
OR

bash
Copy
Edit
yarn start
This will open the application in your default web browser, typically at http://localhost:3000.

Usage
Viewing Users: Upon loading the app, a table will show all the users fetched from the API.
Adding Users: Click on the "Add User" button to open a form and enter the userâ€™s details.
Editing Users: Click on the "Edit" button next to a user to modify their details.
Deleting Users: Click on the "Delete" button to remove a user from the list.
Assumptions
The user data is not persistent in this mock API. Once the page is reloaded, any changes (add/edit/delete) will be lost.
The id field is automatically assigned and not manually editable.
Challenges Faced
Handling the asynchronous nature of API requests using React's state and hooks.
Simulating add/edit/delete functionality using the mock JSONPlaceholder API that doesn't persist data.
Improvements (If given more time)
Implement persistent data storage by integrating a real backend (e.g., Node.js and MongoDB).
Add authentication to restrict who can perform add/edit/delete operations.
Enhance the UI by improving user experience and making it fully responsive.
Contributing
Feel free to fork the repository, make improvements, and submit a pull request. Any contributions are welcome!
